# Fun Calculator 🎉

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator** — a simple, interactive Python program that lets you add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers like a boss! 😎

## Features

- Accepts two numbers as input (supports decimals!)
- Performs basic arithmetic operations:
  - Addition ➕
  - Subtraction ➖
  - Multiplication ✖️
  - Division ➗
- Displays the results with a fun and friendly vibe 🎉

## How to Use

1. Run the Python script.
2. When prompted, enter the first number (decimals allowed).
3. Enter the second number.
4. See the results of all four arithmetic operations instantly displayed.

## Example

```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 3
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 13.0
Difference: 7.0
Product: 30.0
Quotient: 3.3333333333333335
```

## Important Notes

- The calculator uses `float()` to accept decimal numbers.
- Currently, the program does **not** handle division by zero errors — please avoid entering zero as the second number.
  
## Future Improvements

- Add error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero.
- Expand functionality to include more mathematical operations.
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) or web interface.
